This is the circuit and layout for an AVR programmer and SPI interface. It's based on USBtinyISP from [adafruit](http://learn.adafruit.com/usbtinyisp) and you should flash their firmware, because it's also using their USB id. ;-)

However this is a single layer PCB with another form factor. We made this in our Hackerspace [Netz39](http://www.netz39.de/) for the AVR101 and other courses people can attend there.
